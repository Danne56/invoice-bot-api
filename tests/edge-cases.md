// Additional edge case tests that have been implemented:

// Users API:
// - User with active trip status check ✓
// - User with no active trip status check ✓
// - Non-existent user status check ✓

// Trips API:
// - Valid trip creation with default currency ✓
// - Active trip conflict ✓
// - Non-existent user during trip creation ✓
// - Trip stop with zero total amount ✓
// - Trip details with transactions ✓
// - Trips listing with maximum limit (100) ✓
// - Trips listing with invalid limit (>100) ✓

// Transactions API:
// - Transactions with zero subtotal and tax ✓
// - Transactions with all optional fields missing ✓
// - USD transactions with zero amounts (properly rejected) ✓
// - Transactions listing with maximum limit (100) ✓
// - Transactions listing with invalid limit (>100) ✓

// Timer API:
// - Timer start with very short duration (1s) ✓
// - Timer start with very long duration (30d) ✓
// - Timer start with localhost webhook URL ✓
// - Timer restart functionality ✓

// General edge cases that were considered but not implemented:
// - Very large request payloads (handled by express.json limit)
// - Malformed JSON requests (handled by express.json)
// - Requests with unexpected HTTP methods (handled by Express routing)
// - Rate limiting (disabled in test environment)
// - Character encoding issues (UTF-8 is standard)
// - SQL injection attempts (prevented by parameterized queries)
// - Concurrent requests for same resource (complex to test reliably)
// - Database connection failures during transactions (partially covered)
// - Network timeouts (difficult to simulate in tests)
